# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.} 
- As a software engineer, my goal is to excel in the field. While it's often said that no one can master every programming language, I’m committed to learning new ones to diversify my skills, improve my workflow, and increase my job opportunities.

- This is a basic C# program that defines a class called HelloWorld with a method named SayHello. When called, the method prints 'Hello World' and a custom message to the console. It show's how to create a class, define a method also known as function, and use Console.WriteLine(). 

- I created this simple software as my first step into learning C#. My goal is to understand the basic structure of a C# program, including how to define a classes cause I hard that is used a lot, also learn how to create functions which is called methods in c#, and print output to the console. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

- I used Visual Studio Code or VS Code as my code editor because it's easier for understand the IDE and it supports C# development through the C# extension by Microsoft. I also used the .NET SDK and terminal commands to build and run the project with dotnet.

- I wrote this program in C#, it's a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. It’s commonly used for web applications, desktop software, games, and more.
